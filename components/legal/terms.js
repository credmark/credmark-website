                        To access and use some features of the Services, you must register and create an account and become a registered user (“User”). In registering and creating an account, you agree to (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted during the registration and account creation process (“Registration Data”), and (ii) maintain and promptly update your Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account, whether or not you are aware of such activities. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with any system you use to access your account on the Services. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and prohibit you from accessing and using the Services. You agree not to create an account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. You agree not to create an account or to access and use the Services if you have been previously removed by us or if you have been previously banned from accessing and using the Services. We reserve the right to terminate your use of any username for any reason in our sole discretion, with or without notice. Credmark cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.

                        We may also permit you to access and use the Services if you have registered with certain third-party sites, such as Facebook or Google and you authorize Credmark to access your registration information with such third-party sites (through OAuth).

                        Your privacy is important to Credmark. Our goal is to make the Services as good, useful and rewarding for you as possible. In order to do that, Credmark may collect and process information from you when you use the Services, and may transfer this information to trusted third parties working with Credmark to improve the Services (the “Transferred Data”). Transferred Data will always be anonymized. Transferred Data shall only be used for academic research or by Credmark to improve the Services. Credmark will collect certain personally identifiable information from you as set forth in more detail in our Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the Services, you agree that Credmark may collect, use and disclose, as set forth in the Privacy Policy, the information you provide when you access and use the Services, and in some cases, information that is provided by or through any of the Services. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain service communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages.

Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk. If notified by a user of any User Content or other content or materials that allegedly do not conform to these Terms, Credmark may investigate the allegation and determine what recourse, if any, it might have.

                        <br />
                        We are committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and we require all of our Users who disseminate content through the Services to comply with these laws. Accordingly, all Users (including you) may not disseminate any material or content using the Services in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law. Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements. It is our policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate the rights of any user to access the Services if any such User is either found to infringe third-party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who we believe, in our sole discretion, are infringing these rights. Upon our receipt of a proper notice of claimed infringement under the DMCA, we will respond expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the content in issue.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Our designated agent to whom you should address such notice is legal@credmark.com.

                        <br />
                        If you believe that content that you or a third party owns has been used via the Services in a way that violates your or someone else’s copyright or other intellectual property rights, please provide us with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest; (b) a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed; (c) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located; (d) your address, telephone number, email address or other information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you; (e) if possible, information sufficient to allow Credmark to notify the owner/administrator of the allegedly infringing content; (f) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and (g) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in your report is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner&apos;s behalf.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney. If we remove or disable access to allegedly infringing material, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material or content so that they may make a counter notification in accordance with Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Credmark accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their materials.

                        <br />
                        The Services may now or in the future include links or references to other web sites or services (“Third-Party Sites”) solely as a convenience to Users. These links may include payment processing and other sites or services that we think may be of interest to our Users. Credmark does not endorse any such Third-Party Sites or the services, information, materials, products, or services contained on or accessible through Third-Party Sites. In addition, your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers found on or through any of the Services are solely between you and such advertiser. Access and use of Third-Party Sites, including the information, materials, products, and services on or available through Third-Party Sites are solely at your own risk.
                        <strong>
                            9. Termination.
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        You agree that Credmark in its sole discretion, for any or no reason, and without penalty, may terminate your access and use of the Services or any account (or any part thereof) that you may have with Credmark and remove and discard all or any part of your account and user profile at any time. Credmark may also in its sole discretion and at any time prohibit you from accessing and using the Services or discontinue providing access to the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that Credmark will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. Credmark reserves the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Credmark to disclose the identity of anyone posting any content that are believed to violate these Terms. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies that Credmark may have at law or in equity. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU WAIVE AND SHALL HOLD CREDMARK HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY CREDMARK DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER CREDMARK OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Your only remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with (a) the Services, (b) any term of these Terms, (c) any policy or practice of Credmark in operating the Services, or (d) any Content viewable through the Services is to terminate your use of the Services and your account. You may terminate your use of the Services and your account at any time. After such termination, you must refrain from use of the Services until authorized by Credmark.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Upon termination of these Terms, your use of the Services or your relationship with Credmark, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
                        <br />

                        10. Indemnity
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        You agree to indemnify, save, and hold harmless Credmark its affiliated companies, contractors, employees, agents and its third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners from any third-party claims, losses, damages, or liabilities, including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses, arising out of (a) your use or misuse of the Services or any Content, (b) any violation by you of these Terms, (c) your User Content or (d) any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein. Credmark reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Credmark and you agree to cooperate with Credmark’ defense of these claims. Credmark will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it

                        11. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Credmark and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Credmark Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result some of the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, CREDMARK AND ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CREDMARK PARTIES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, CREDMARK PROVIDES NO WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULTS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE CREDMARK PARTIES OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE SERVICES, ANY DATA, ASSESSMENTS, RESULTS, INFORMATION, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY SITE, SERVICES, OR APPLICATIONS MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        THE CREDMARK PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE DATA, RESULTS, CONTENT, FUNCTIONS, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN CONTENT, INFORMATION, MATERIALS, ASSESSMENTS, RESULTS OR DATA THROUGH THE SERVICES OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SITE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF SUCH MATERIAL OR DATA.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, NEGLIGENCE, WILL THE CREDMARK PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY UNSUCCESSFUL COURT ACTION OR LEGAL DISPUTE, LOST BUSINESS, LOST REVENUES OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR NON-PECUNIARY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE OR YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE CREDMARK CONTENT, THE SERVICES OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SITE, OR ANY OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH CREDMARK OR ANY OTHER USER, EVEN IF CREDMARK OR A CREDMARK AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, CREDMARK’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        IN NO EVENT WILL THE CREDMARK PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE CREDMARK CONTENT, THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, OR YOUR INTERACTION WITH OTHER USERS (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE), EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $25 AND (B) AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ANY MEMBERSHIP OR USER FEES PAID BY YOU DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If you have a dispute with any other Users or other third parties, you hereby release Credmark and the other Credmark Parties from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU BY REASON OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR PROVIDED ON ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES OR OTHERWISE BY THIRD PARTIES OTHER THAN CREDMARK AND RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON ANY OF THE SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT CREDMARK HAS OFFERED THE CREDMARK CONTENT AND THE SERVICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS, IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND CREDMARK, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND CREDMARK. CREDMARK WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AUTHORIZE YOU TO ACCESS AND USE OF THE CREDMARK CONTENT OR THE SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>13. Dispute Resolution</strong>
                        <br />
                        If a dispute arises between you and Credmark, the goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective method of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Credmark agree that any dispute, claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or the Services (a “Dispute”) will be resolved in accordance with this Section or as Credmark and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these dispute methods, Credmark strongly encourages you to first contact Credmark directly to seek a resolution. Credmark reserves all rights and remedies against any Users who violate these Terms.

                        These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE SERVICES

                        <strong>PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong>
                        <br />
                        YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND CREDMARK (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION AND YOU AND CREDMARK HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN ENGLISH AND THE PLACE OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE AUSTIN, TEXAS. YOUR ARBITRATION FEES AND YOUR SHARE OF ARBITRATOR COMPENSATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH RULES. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND CREDMARK WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Neither you nor Credmark will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any disputes covered by these Terms to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST CREDMARK INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Credmark is a party to the proceeding.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Credmark agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the federal or state courts covering Austin, Texas. Both you and Credmark irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Credmark may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to legal@credmark.com. The notice must be sent to Credmark within thirty (30) days of your use of any of the Services or agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

                        <br />
                        All claims you bring against Credmark must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Credmark may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $15,000, provided that Credmark has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the event that either party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other party arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any of the Services, the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs.

                        ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY, ANY OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CREDMARK MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

                        <br />
                        No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms. The parties agree that nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, employer/employee, or similar relationship between the parties, or as authorizing either party to act as the agent of the other. The failure of Credmark to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Credmark. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Credmark without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Credmark and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Credmark that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Credmark and you regarding the Services and Content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Credmark reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms at any time by posting the amended Terms to the Site or any of the Services. If Credmark updates these Terms, it will update the “Updated as of” date at the top of the Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. In the event of a change to these Terms that materially modifies your rights or obligations (including applicable fees), Credmark will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of such change. Credmark may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within any of the Services, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an account, or through other similar mechanisms. Additionally, if the changed Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, Credmark may require you to provide consent by accepting the changed Terms. If Credmark requires your acceptance of the changed Terms, changes are effective only after your acceptance. For all other changes, except as stated elsewhere by Credmark, such amended Terms or fees will automatically be effective, replacing the previously-effective Terms or fees, thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on any of the Services. IF AT ANY TIME YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF ALL SERVICES. To the extent that any modifications to the Terms are not allowed under applicable laws, the prior most recent version of the Terms shall continue to apply.
